# ALX Software Enginering Printf Team Project

This project is a team project that contains a custom made printf function for C language.
It takes various inputs and arguments based on how the standard printf library function works.


## Printf function

This is a simple implementation of printf function that formats and prints data

### Description
The _printf() function produces output according to a format which is described below. This function write its output to the stdout, the standard output stream. Returns the count of printed characters when the function is successful and -1 when the function fails.

The available convertion specifiers are:

* %c: Prints a single character.
* %s: Prints a string of characters.
* %d: Prints integers.
* %i: Prints integers.
* %b: Prints the binary representation of an unsigned decimal.
* %u: Prints unsigned integers
* %x: Prints the hexadecimal representation of an unsigned decimal in lowercase letters
* %X: Prints the hexadecimal representation of an unsigned decimal in uppercase letters
* %r: Prints a reversed string
* %R: Prints the Rot13 interpretation of a string:

## Format of the string

The format string is a character string starting and ending with double quotes. The format string is composed of zero or more directives; ordinary characters (not %), and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.
